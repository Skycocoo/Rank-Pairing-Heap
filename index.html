		<title> Introduction </title>
		<content> 
			Rank Pairing Heap is intended to achieve same time complexity as Fibonacci Heap, but have a simpler structure to implement.
			
			// here goes comparison of time complexity between Rank Pairing Heap and Fibonacci Heap

			<title> Basic Structure </title>
			<content>
				Rank Pairing Heap uses a data structure of binary half tree, which is an alternative representation of heap tree. For a node in half tree, its left child is the first child in the heap-ordered representation, and its right child is the next siblinbg. Half tree has a property that a node is smaller than any nodes in its left spin. Therefore, a half-tree should look like below, where the root only have left child.
				
				// here goes diagram of a heap and its corresponding half tree representation
				
				Rank Pairing Heap contains a set of half trees which are linked circularly. The head of the linked list is the minimum element among all nodes in the Rank Pairing Heap.
